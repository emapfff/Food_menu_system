# Description:
I implemented a menu system for a restaurant. The menu should consist of different menu items and submenus, and allow adding or removing items.<br /> Menu items might have additional attributes, such as being vegetarian or spicy.<br />
I used the composite and decorator design patterns to realize the system described above and note:
- A menu item has a name and price
- All methods should have corresponding implementations
#### Created a Runner class. Starting from a root menu, print out all the menu items and submenus with their corresponding cost.
